# Classification of OOPs Topics

Yes üëç we can group **constructors and destructor together** under a single section, since they both handle the **lifecycle management of objects** (creation & cleanup).

Here‚Äôs the improved classification with that adjustment:

---

## 1. Introduction

- Overview of OOPs concepts and importance
    

---

## 2. Basics of OOP

- What is OOPs? (00:35)
    
- Class & Objects (05:02)
    
- Empty Class (11:12)
    
- Behind the Scenes of Objects (27:09)
    

---

## 3. Encapsulation & Access Control

- Access Modifiers (16:00)
    
- Getter & Setter Functions (22:00)
    
- Homework (28:45)
    

---

## 4. Memory Allocation

- Static vs Dynamic Allocation (29:50)
    

---

## 5. Object Lifecycle: Construction & Destruction

- Constructor Basics (35:14)
    
- Default Constructor (37:31)
    
- Parameterized Constructor (40:50)
    
- `this` Keyword (42:00)
    
- Copy Constructor (49:08)
    
- Destructor (01:12:04)
    
- Homework (01:16:47)
    

---

## 6. Object Copying & Assignment

- Shallow vs Deep Copy (59:46)
    
- Assignment Operator Overloading (01:09:32)
    

---

## 7. Static Members

- Static Keyword (01:17:40)
    
- Static Functions (01:23:00)
    

---

## 8. Wrap-Up

- Summary / Revision (01:26:10)

### ‚úÖ Why this is better:

- **Constructors + Destructor** are now in one section ‚Üí highlights full lifecycle (creation ‚Üí initialization ‚Üí destruction).
    
- **Copying & Assignment** stays separate, since it‚Äôs more about object behavior than lifecycle.
    
- Flow is still progressive and easy for learners.
    

üëâ Do you want me to also **reorder Copying & Assignment** to come _inside_ the lifecycle section (between Copy Constructor & Destructor) so it flows as: Creation ‚Üí Copy ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Destruction?
